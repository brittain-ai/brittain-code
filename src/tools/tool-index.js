// Tool schemas are sent in full on every request, and they are not small: the
// 55 code-mode tools cost roughly 8,000 tokens before a single message is
// added. Against a 262k local window that is noise. Against a 32k served model
// it is a quarter of the budget spent on describing tools the turn will never
// call.
//
// So the payload is split. A short list of tools used almost every turn keeps
// its full schema. Everything else is advertised with its name, its first
// sentence, and the names and types of its required arguments — enough for the
// model to pick it and usually to call it correctly — with the descriptions and
// optional arguments left out. A tool that is called without the arguments it
// needs has its real schema handed back as the tool result rather than an
// error, and is promoted to full for the rest of the conversation.
//
// The stubs are still declared as ordinary tools rather than listed in the
// system prompt. That is deliberate: a server doing guided or grammar-based
// tool parsing (vLLM's qwen3_xml among them) constrains generation to the
// declared tools, so a tool named only in prose may be one the model is
// incapable of emitting a call for.
